üá∫üá∏ This project uses Flowise to create a basic AI agent that generates articles, posts, and scripts for influencers, allowing users to explore Flowise's capabilities and tools.  

Features:  
- Generates a blog article, a YouTube video title, a script, and X (Twitter) posts.  
- Based on OpenAI's API, it uses the **4o-mini** model in the demonstration, but **4o** is recommended for intensive use.  
- Easy to configure and adapt to any niche (I used fitness).  
- Perfect for amateur influencers.
